      <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/#WhatIsNutshell">:Nutshells</a> are a great tool for "expandable explanations."
      You can use them by simply adding <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/#HowDoIUse">:a few lines</a> to your code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an example of a <a href="#HiddenHeadingName">:hidden nutshell</a> for your own content.  
      When you click it, the hidden heading below will reveal itself here. 
      It uses the "#" symbol at the beginning of the link destination (which indicates a link to a heading on the current page).
      The displayed text of the link must begin with ":" as that's how Nutshell knows to transform it.
    </p>
    <h2>:x Hidden Heading Name</h2>
    <p>This will be invisible until it is revealed. The heading text must begin with ":x" to hide itself.</p>
